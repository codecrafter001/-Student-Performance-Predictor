# 🎓 Student Performance Prediction System

An end-to-end **Machine Learning & Flask web application** that predicts a student's final academic score based on study habits and prior performance. This project demonstrates how a trained ML model can be integrated into a web application and deployed on a cloud platform like Render.

---

## 🚀 Overview

The Student Performance Prediction System uses a **Linear Regression model** to estimate a student's final score using key academic indicators such as:

- Study hours per day  
- Attendance percentage  
- Previous exam score  

The trained model is served through a **Flask web interface**, allowing users to input values and receive instant predictions.
